# Hi 👋, I'm Mathew Koech

## About Me

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Backend Development**. I’m deeply committed to building high-quality applications that help businesses grow and improve efficiency. I specialize in modern backend technologies like **Django** and **Laravel**, and I’m also expanding my knowledge into **React**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**.

Currently, I’m working on a live **ERP SaaS** ([serow.app](https://serow.app)), which has been actively used by businesses for over two years. I’m part of a dedicated team improving the product, and we are offering it on a subscription-based model. Beyond that, I’m always exploring new technologies and looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects.

I enjoy solving complex challenges and constantly learning and adapting to new tools and technologies. Let’s connect if you’re looking for a passionate and versatile developer!
